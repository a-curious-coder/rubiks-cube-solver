\section{Introduction}
This is my attempt at a Rubik's Cube Solver. I will be doing my best to log the progress I make and what motivate my decisions regarding  features and methods I include.
\subsection{Background}
The Rubik's Cube is a well known puzzle all around the world and it's considered extremely difficult to solve.
\subsection{Aims and Objectives}
My ambitious goal is to create some form of heuristic based search algorithm or perhaps a constraint solver to solve the cube and perhaps various cube sizes. However, it's very likely I could stray and use a different, more efficient and well suited algorithm to solve the cube(s).
\\
A cool feature I'm eager to add is a custom scramble where the user can manually change the digital cube to their real world physical cube's scrambled state then get my program to solve it and provide the algorithm (steps) to solving that particular scramble.

\subsection{Research Hypothesis}
Although this project is ambitious, I'm hoping that with my current experience solving Rubik's Cubes, this project will move forward more fluently than previous projects I've pursued and hopefully I'm able to better diagnose, understand and solve issues during the project creation.

I'm excited to discover if I can create or piece together an algorithm that is versatile enough to solve different sized cubes but considering that I feel this project is a big challenge regarding just the 3x3x3 sized cube, I wouldn't be too disappointed if I didn't succeed in creating an algorithm that can solve all sized cubes.
